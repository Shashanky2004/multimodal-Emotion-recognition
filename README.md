# multimodal-Emotion-recognition
Multimodal emotion recognition integrates NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio Processing to identify emotions from text, images, and sound. Using models like BERT, ResNet-50, and CNNs/RNNs, it fuses features through attention mechanisms and combines intermediate and late fusion techniques, enhancing accuracy via Capsule Networks and transfer learning.
